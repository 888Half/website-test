<!-- If you need to update the site, make changes here then go to github, write summary and commit to main and hit "Push to orgin" the changes should show online:
	this is this websites url: https://888half.github.io/website-test/website%20test.html

 PIC PROBLEMS? If somehow all the file paths and extensions are correct, but u r still getting a broken image after uploading it online it could be the file permissions ie: it needs to be accsessible by everyone -->
